**Pystagram** is a photo sharing app similar to Instagram but using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- At first, I cannot open Parse at 0.0.0.0:4040, and I solved it by switching to localhost:4040
- In ParseApplication, http://py-gram.herokuapp.com/parse does not work. I used https instead to solve the problem.
- It took me a while to understand how to achieve the persistence part
- Camera and file part is hard to understand, still trying to absolve these codes!

## Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Android
